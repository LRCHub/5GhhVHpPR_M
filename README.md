[00:00.63] We may not know which way to go on this dark road
[00:25.13] 
[00:10.89] (Mr. Duckworth)
[00:12.38] All of these hoes make it difficult
[00:29.88] 
[00:21.57] Session ten, breakthrough
[00:34.07] 
[00:27.85] One of these lives, I'ma make things right
[00:29.40] With the wrongs I've done, that's one of you now
[00:31.23] With the Father, Son, 'til then, I fight
[00:33.24] Rain on me, put the blame on me
[00:34.67] Got guilt, got hurt, got shame on me
[00:36.59] Got six magazines that's aimed at me
[00:38.29] Done every magazine, what's fame to me?
[00:57.79] 
[00:40.00] It's a game to me, where the bedroom at? (And I'm tripping and falling)
[00:42.29] Sleep, I ain't never had affairs with that
[00:43.96] What's fed when the hearts and the words don't reach?
[00:45.44] What's fair when the money don't take things back?
[00:47.39] It's rare when somebody take your dreams back
[01:09.89] 
[00:49.19] I care too much, wanna share too much (and I'm tripping and falling)
[00:50.93] In my head too much, I shut down too
[00:52.70] I ain't there too much, I'm a complex soul
[00:54.56] They layered me up, then broke me down
[00:56.29] And morality's dust, I lack in trust
[01:14.29] 
[00:58.17] This time around, I trust myself (and I'm tripping and falling)
[01:00.09] Please everybody else but myself
[01:01.64] All else fails, I was myself
[01:03.30] Outdone fear, outdone myself
[01:05.41] This year, you better one yourself
[01:22.41] 
[01:07.29] Masks on the babies, mask on an opp (and I'm tripping and falling)
[01:08.51] Wear masks in the neighborhood stores you shop
[01:10.53] But a mask won't hide who you are inside
[01:12.30] Look around, the reality's carved in the lies
[01:14.33] Wipe my ego, dodge my pride
[01:27.83] 
[01:15.95] Look myself in the mirror (and I'm tripping and falling)
[01:17.50] Amityville, I ain't seen nothing scarier (on and on and on and on)
[01:19.52] I fought like a Pitbull Terrier, blood I shed could fill up aquariums
[01:23.12] Tell all my angels, "Carry 'em" (and I'm tripping and falling)
[01:25.05] Every emotion been deprived, even my strong points couldn't survive
[01:28.62] If I didn't learn to love myself, forgive myself a hundred times, dawg
[02:03.62] 
[01:35.66] I love when you count me out (huh)
[01:37.60] I love when you count me out
[01:39.29] I love when you count me out (brrah, ooh, brrah, ooh, brrah)
[01:42.65] I love when you count me out (brrah, ooh, brrah, ooh, brrah)
[01:44.68] Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fucking it up
[01:48.59] How you gon' win my trust when the lies run deep? (Brrah, ooh, brrah)
[01:51.95] How you gon' bend your love when the bad don't sleep?
[01:55.54] Beep, beep, crash our feelings in the middle of the street (vroom, vroom)
[01:58.84] Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fucking it up
[02:29.34] 
[02:02.44] When you was at your lowest, tell me, where the hoes was at?
[02:06.04] When you was at your lowest, tell me, where the bros was at?
[02:09.78] 3:30 in the morning, scroll through the call log
[02:13.15] Ain't nobody but the mirror looking for the fall off (brrr)
[02:42.65] 
[02:16.71] I love when you count me out
[02:18.47] I love when you count me out
[02:20.43] I love when you count me out
[02:22.13] I love when you count me out (brrah, ooh, brrah, ooh, brrah)
[02:25.54] My name is in your mouth, shoo, shoo
[02:43.54] 
[02:29.56] It's gon' take more than pride to stop
[02:32.87] Call 911, I caught a body
[02:36.59] Sun up now, yesterday is fading
[02:40.19] Healing's only one mile away
[02:54.19] 
[02:43.63] Let me tell you 'bout the women I know (that's my baby)
[02:47.22] I know karma like to follow us strong (sheesh)
[02:48.98] I know millionaires that feel alone (sheesh)
[02:50.88] Anytime I couldn't find God, I still could find myself through a song
[02:54.30] Many find they life in a phone
[03:09.30] 
[02:55.80] Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fucking it up
[03:26.30] 
[02:58.16] You said I'd feel better if I just worked hard
[03:01.53] Without lifting my head up, that left me fed up
[03:05.56] You made me worry, I wanted my best version
[03:09.12] But you ignored me, then changed the story
[03:12.55] Then changed the story
[03:23.55] 
[03:14.35] Good energy in the room, drop the location, please
[03:17.68] Antibiotic for the womb when I'm frustrated, please
[03:19.77] (Antibiotic for the womb when I'm frustrated)
[03:21.56] Tryna keep my good conscious in rotation (no, no)
[03:25.27] Thoughts in my head, they living there with no (tryna keep my good)
[03:58.77] 
[03:27.96] I made a decision, never give you my feelings
[03:31.32] Fuck with you from, fuck with you from a distance
[03:34.71] Some put it on the devil when they fall short
[03:38.55] I put it on my ego, lord of all lords
[03:41.24] Sometimes I fall for her, dawg
[03:56.24]
